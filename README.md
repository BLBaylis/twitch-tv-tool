This is my Twitch.Tv Tool, which will show you the availability of some Twitch channels recommended by Freecodecamp.org and myself.  If they are online, you will see information about their stream and you can search for the same info about other streamers.  Additionally, you can see the featured streams of Twitch.tv itself, which you would see if you visited their homepage.

Here is the live site : [https://blbaylis.github.io/twitch-tv-tool](https://blbaylis.github.io/twitch-tv-tool/).
